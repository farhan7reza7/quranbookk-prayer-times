## The Five Daily Prayers: Foundation of Islamic Practice

### Historical Origins and Divine Command

The institution of five daily prayers (*Salawat*) holds a unique place in Islamic history. According to Islamic tradition, the obligation of prayer was established during the Prophet Muhammad's miraculous night journey (*Isra and Mi'raj*) to Jerusalem and ascension to heaven. Initially commanded to pray fifty times daily, the number was reduced to five through the Prophet's intercession, yet these five prayers retain the spiritual reward of fifty.

This divine origin underscores the fundamental nature of prayer in Islam‚Äîit's not merely a human invention or cultural practice, but a direct command from Allah that serves as the cornerstone of Muslim spiritual life.
